Thread::Barrier    bdpOp  Thread barriers for Perl                MROGASKI


Thread barriers provide a mechanism for synchronization of multiple 
threads.  All threads issuing a "wait" on the barrier will block until 
the count of waiting threads meets some threshold value.  This mechanism
proves quite useful in situations where processing progresses in stages
and completion of the current stage by all threads is the entry criteria
for the next stage.

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.


INSTALLATION
